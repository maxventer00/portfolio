            Moved on to functionality based user stories at the beginning of
            January and spent a lot of time working on design. All designs and
            flows were on figma, pixel perfect design conformance was followed
            aided with design reviews

            After the lead developer on the project was let go, I offered to
            step up into the role of lead front-end development in the
            intermediary time period with the help of another intern developer
            that also joined the project.

            Handled lead front-end development until September 2021 when the
            project was coming to a close due to scope-creep/business decisions.
            Working on coding complex user flows and integration with our
            backend as well as third party services and integration such as
            google's location API, google analytics, and Stripes payment API
